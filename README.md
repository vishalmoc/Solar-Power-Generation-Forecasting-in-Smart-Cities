## Solar-Power-Generation-Forecasting-in-Smart-Cities
Solar power forecasting using Random Forest, SVR, CNN, CNN-LSTM, and Seq2Seq models on the BigML dataset. Models evaluated with MSE, RMSE, MAE, RÂ². SHAP used for explainable AI to interpret feature impact and improve smart city solar energy prediction accuracy.
#Dataset related information
The dataset contains time-series data with weather and environmental variables recorded for solar power generation prediction, including daily, monthly, and hourly intervals.
Key features include day of year, year, month, day, daylight indicator, distance to solar noon, and time period (hour).
Weather-related attributes comprise average temperature, wind direction, wind speed, sky cover, visibility, relative humidity, and barometric pressure for the time period.
The target variable is power generated, representing the solar power output corresponding to the given environmental and temporal conditions.
The dataset covers multiple continuous records for a full year cycle (365 days) to capture seasonal and daily solar power generation patterns with associated weather data.
