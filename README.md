# Solar-Power-Generation-Forecasting-in-Smart-Cities
Solar power forecasting using ML and Explainable AI (SHAP). Uses Berkeley dataset with LightGBM, XGBoost, and RNN models for 7-, 15-, and 30-day forecasts. LightGBM gives best long-term accuracy; SHAP shows Distance to Solar Noon and Sky Cover as key factors in power prediction.
